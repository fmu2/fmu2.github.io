I research **multimodal intelligence** and advance **Generative AI** across data, modeling, and systems optimization.

I am currently an AI Research Scientist at Meta Superintelligence Labs, building world-class video generation and editing models. Previously, I was a Senior Deep Learning Algorithms Engineer at NVIDIA, where I worked on inference optimization of multimodal LLMs. I graduated with a PhD in [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Prof. [Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/). Before that, I received my Master's degrees in Computer Sciences and Pharmaceutical Sciences from UW-Madison, and a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Zhejiang University.
