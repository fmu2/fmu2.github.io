I am currently a Senior Deep Learning Algorithms Engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/). I graduated with a PhD in [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) (advisor: Prof. [Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/)) in December 2023. Previously, I received Master's degrees in Computer Sciences and Pharmaceutical Sciences from UW-Madison, and a Bachelor's degree in Biology from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I am broadly interested in **computer vision** and **machine learning**. I have worked on computational imaging, 3D vision, image generation and manipulation, video understanding, and foundations of deep learning. These days, I combine (Multimodal) Foundation Models to enable (1) visual inference by re-creating the inputs (*analysis by synthesis*), and (2) content generation and manipulation through visual understanding (*synthesis by analysis*).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
